## Study Abroad
We strongly encourage our students to study for a semester or more in one of the countries they learn about in the Arabic, Asian Studies, Chinese and Japanese curriculums. Study abroad that includes participation in an intensive language program is an especially valuable way for students to develop a high level of proficiency in the language they are studying. These programs are designed to improve participants’ oral, listening, reading and writing proficiency in their target language and develop their knowledge regarding the history, politics, culture and society of that country. Combining intensive language classes with experience abroad prepares students to compete for careers on a global level. Credits earned through the study abroad programs may be used toward a minor and/or certificate.

There are additional approved external study abroad program providers that offer programs in Asia.They include the Alliance for Global Education, the School for Field Studies, the Education Abroad Network, SIT Study Abroad, Syracuse University, USAC, IES Abroad, Boston University and the University of Minnesota.

## Foreign Language Placement, Waiver and Assessment Requests
For questions about placement, waivers, and assessments, please arrange to meet the appropriate Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, Hindi, or Korean advisor by emailing [asian_studies@temple.edu](mailto:asian_studies@temple.edu).

For languages not offered at the university, students have the option of taking an online language assessment exam. The exam vendor must first be approved by the department chair. Students should then complete the Foreign Language Assessment Request and Certification form and complete the first two sections, “Student Identification Information” and “Language Background and Information.” Students should next meet with a CLA academic advisor, bringing this form as well as any relevant documentation, such as a transcript or diploma, to demonstrate their background in the assessment language.
